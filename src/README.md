This is the source code for the project. 
Running the main.ipynb file will give an understanding on how these py files work and run together. 

hplot gives important meaningful graphs that were used in the paper. 


The other folder contains graphs, but those files need updated directories since this is no longer being run Google Colab.
Also, some of the graphs may need to be adjusted to take into accound that the solution graph may no longer by in ppb. 
Update September 5, 2022 changed future.py to be in moles instead of ppb.
